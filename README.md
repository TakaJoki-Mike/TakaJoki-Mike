## Hello there, you can view my portfolio here!

### Here are a few words about myself

My name is Michael, but you can call me Mike. I am a junior QA engineer with experience in APIs and SQL. I enjoy spending my free time reading and watching educational content related to testing. I believe my best qualities are perseverance and dedication. I often encounter unique problems and devote myself to finding solutions, regardless of time or effort required.

### Please find below the details of a projects I worked on:

<details>
    <summary> <b>First project</b> </summary>
    
**Name:** *Skyeng Web Application Test for Teachers*  
**User-story:** *The teacher can schedule personal events and set reminders for their meetings.*

**Tasks Assigned:**
- Test "Personal events"
- Select the appropriate testing type, justify the selection, create and manage test documents.
- Enter and prioritize test cases in the Test Management System (TMS).
- Identify and report bugs using TMS.
- Demonstrate the skills acquired in the course by applying them in practical scenarios.

**Project solution:**  

- After conducting an analysis of the scheduling system, a [decomposition](https://github.com/TakaJoki-Mike/Portfolio/blob/main/Files/Projectscreens/miro.jpg) was created.

- A set of [checklists](https://github.com/TakaJoki-Mike/Portfolio/blob/main/Files/Projectscreens/sitechco.jpg) and [test cases](https://github.com/TakaJoki-Mike/Portfolio/tree/main/Files/Projectscreens/Qase.io) were put together.
- Discovered [errors](https://github.com/TakaJoki-Mike/Portfolio/tree/main/Files/Projectscreens/Bugs).
- The checks have been successfully carried out and their results have been recorded. The document was formatted using the [Confluence](https://github.com/TakaJoki-Mike/Portfolio/blob/main/Files/Projectscreens/work_in_confluence.jpg) application.

**Conclusions:**  
As a result of the project, the following outcomes were achieved:
A [bug related to highlight text](https://github.com/TakaJoki-Mike/Portfolio/tree/main/Files/Projectscreens/Bugs/Conclusion) has been discovered, which causes the form to close with all the entered data. This issue could result in a bad impression of the application for users. It is important to fix this bug before releasing the application to ensure a smooth user experience.

    <summary> <b>Second project</b> </summary>
  
**Name:** *Skyeng Web Application Test for Teachers*  
**User-story:** *The teacher can schedule personal events to serve as reminders for their own meetings.*

**Tasks Assigned:**

- Test "Personal events" 
- Testing an application using the API
- Demonstrate the skills acquired in the course by applying them in practical situations. 

**Project solution:**  

- Postman was used to perform API testing. You can see a collection [here](https://github.com/TakaJoki-Mike/Portfolio/blob/main/Files/API/API%20coure%20work.postman_collection%20(1).json).

  [<img src="/Files/API/postman.png" width="700" height="250">](https://github.com/TakaJoki-Mike/Portfolio/blob/main/Files/API/API%20coure%20work.postman_collection%20(1).json)
- The document was formatted using the [Confluence](https://github.com/TakaJoki-Mike/Portfolio/blob/main/Files/Projectscreens/work_in_confluence.jpg) application.

**Conclusions:**  
As a result of the project, the following outcomes were achieved: All events were created, edited, and deleted. I wrote 3 API test cases, which cannot be tested through the interface. It wasn't possible to substitute an invalid date or time, but I was able to modify the colour of a personal event to blue, which isn't an available option when creating an event through the interface. The response status code was always 200; however, in case of an empty name or invalid time, the response body contained an error description.
